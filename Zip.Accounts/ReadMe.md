Solution using Asp.Net Core and Onion Architecture
==================================================

## How to run
1. Dependencies - Visual Studio and SQL Server 
2. Build the solution
3. Update SQL Server instance name in "Zip.Accounts.Api" project
4. Run update-database
5. Start api using "Ctrl + F5"
6. Run api using swagger: https://localhost:44321/swagger/index.html

I tried to run with dockers, but docker is not supported on my laptop. So, skipped that for now.
